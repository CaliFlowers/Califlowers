I love trivia, musicals, and just being free-spirited in general. I like to learn new things. I'm not the quickest at picking up new things; but I'm willing to persevere until I master something. I don't just pursue education to get a better salary or job; I study new things because I genuinely believe in pursuing enlightenment about the universe. It is my highest wish to understand the poetry hidden in the mathematical order of the Universe; so that I my set it to my music.
